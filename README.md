# pygtsam
Python wrappers for [GTSAM 3](https://research.cc.gatech.edu/borg/download?destination=node%2F299). 

This previously lived [here](https://github.com/spillai/conda-recipes-slam/tree/master/pygtsam/pygtsam) but it made sense to move it a separate repo. 

## Contribute
Feel free to contribute new factors and python-based applications for GTSAM on this branch, I'm sure [Frank Dellaert](http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dellaert/FrankDellaert/Frank_Dellaert/Frank_Dellaert.html) will be ecstatic that more people are using factor graphs.
